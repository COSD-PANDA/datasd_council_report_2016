\#Portal Launch

\#\#Picking a portal

At its most basic, an open data portal is really just a website containing a catalog of City data. We needed this catalog to be as easy to navigate for less technical users as for advanced users. After extensively reviewing several options for data portals, DKAN became our technology of choice. With DKAN, users can search or browse the catalog as well as filter results by topic, publishing department, or tag name. Users can download a dataset, or preview it within the website and perform basic filtering. DKAN has a content management system that allowed us to customize the content and layout of our home page to optimize usability. We were also able to add informative, non-catalog content, such as a Get Started page with a tutorial on how to use the portal and narrative Data Stories that display City data on maps and with charts.

The DKAN website is powered on the back-end by Drupal and is open source. This gave us two distinct advantages. First, the recent website redesign at sandiego.gov is built with Drupal, so we have people all over the City who have been trained in using that technology. Second, open source means we can capitalize on the knowledge of a large community of developers who are contributing code, as well as contribute our own code to improve the product. We also have the flexibility to switch portal providers at a minimal cost if at some point we no longer wish to do business with GovDelivery \(the vendor hosting DKAN for us\).

Another important aspect of DKAN is that it complies with the federal DCAT schemas. DCAT stands for Data Catalog Vocabulary, and it sets standards to follow for governments publishing data. For example, each dataset must come with certain pieces of information, including the date it was released, and the date it was last modified. This kind of information -- data that describes data -- is also known as metadata. DCAT also gives guidance on how to organize government data catalogs. We are one of only a few cities compliant with DCAT as DKAN is the only data portal that fully supports it.
